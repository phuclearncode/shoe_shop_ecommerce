# Sneaker Ecommerce

> I've improved and updated the front-end code on the improve/legacy-code branch. If you're having issues starting the project with the backend, use this branch. I'll be improving the backend code and connecting it soon.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was an opportunity for me to utilize my self-taught front-end skills and existing back-end knowledge to build an ecommerce platform. However, my skills in both areas were not sufficient, and I lacked full-stack knowledge, including how to establish communication between the front end and back end. Despite these challenges, I took pride in this project because it motivated me to learn and explore various technologies, such as C# Web API, Redux, JWT tokens, and HTTP methods and API development in general.

### Built With

* React.js
* Microsoft SQL Server
* .NET Web API
* Redux
* SCSS

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mariangle/ecommerce-app-ms-sql-net-react.git
   ```

2. Back end:
   * Configure your database connection details in an `app.config` file.
   * Build and run the solution file from the "Backend" folder in Visual Studio.

> Note: This project is dated, and there are many aspects I would approach differently now. I am no longer actively developing it. However, if you intend to clone or fork it: The database was initially set up using SQL statements, which were not saved. Starting the project may be challenging due to this. I recommend using Entity Framework's update-database command to recreate the database schema based on the models.


3. Front end:
   * Navigate to the "Frontend" directory 
   * Install required npm packages   

     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
     
   * Start the front end development server   

     ```sh
     npm start
     ```
